# Asks for each GitHub Actions secret Floe's workflows use and stores it on
# thaw-app/Floe with gh. The signing secrets go in the "prod" environment, so
# only jobs approved for that environment can read them. Press Return to skip
# one; skipped secrets are left as they are. Input is hidden and never written to disk. Answer with @ and a path
# to read a value from a file.

# Usage:
#   ./scripts/set-secrets.sh          # ask for every secret
#   ./scripts/set-secrets.sh --list   # show what is set on GitHub now

Export it from Keychain Access (My Certificates, right-click, Export) and answer here with @ and the file's path, for example @~/Desktop/DeveloperID.p12; the script encodes it."
    "APPLE_APPLICATION_CERT_PASSWORD|prod|signing|The password you chose when exporting that .p12."
    "APPLE_TEAM_ID|prod|signing|Your 10-character Apple Developer team ID, from developer.apple.com/account under Membership details."
    "APPLE_ID|prod|notarization|The Apple ID email of the developer account that notarizes the app."
    "APPLE_ID_PASSWORD|prod|notarization|An app-specific password for that Apple ID, created at account.apple.com under Sign-In and Security, App-Specific Passwords. Not your account password."
    "SONAR_TOKEN||analysis|Token for the SonarQube Cloud scan in CI. Create it at sonarcloud.io under My Account, Security. It stays a repository secret because the scan runs on every push and pull request."
    "SCORECARD_READ_TOKEN||optional|Fine-grained personal access token for the Scorecard workflow, so its Branch-Protection check can read the repository's settings. Create it at github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens with access to thaw-app/Floe and read-only Administration. Without it the workflow falls back to its own token and that one check is less complete."
