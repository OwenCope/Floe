//  Thaw 3's settings search index (Settings/Search/SearchIndex.swift), with the entry reshaped
//  for Floe: strings already in the user's language instead of localization keys, so the search
//  matches what is on screen, Floe's SettingsPage as the pane, and a scroll anchor where Thaw
//  has a disclosure. The entries themselves are Floe's and live in SettingsSearchEntries.swift.
