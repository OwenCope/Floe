//  Ported to Floe from Droppy Code's Services/Providers/TextGeneration.swift, and modified: the
//  thread title and commit message prompts are left out, the prompt is the caller's, every engine
//  takes an optional model, a failure is thrown with the tool's own words, the arguments are
//  built by a function a test can call, claude's answer can be streamed (ClaudeTextStream.swift),
//  and opencode and pi are engines too (OpencodeTextStream.swift, PiTextStream.swift).
